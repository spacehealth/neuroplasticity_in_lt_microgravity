## Neuroplasticity in long-term microgravity

  We analyze the properties and movement of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) to better understand how neuroplasticity occurs after extended exposure to microgravity.

  Below is the list of the CSF properties (7) that we aim to study:
1. CSF Flow Dynamics: Velocity, direction, and pressure changes in microgravity.
2. CSF Volume and Pressure: Intracranial pressure (ICP) and its effects on brain regions.
3. CSF Composition: Growth factors (BDNF, nerve growth factor), proteins, and neurotransmitters.
4. CSF Circulation and Glymphatic Function: Waste clearance efficiency and implications for brain health.
5. CSF pH and Ionic Composition: Balance of ions and pH related to neural activity and plasticity.
6. CSF Involvement in Neuroinflammation: Inflammatory markers and their impact on neuroplasticity.
7. CSF-Driven Mechanical Forces: Redistribution and mechanical impacts on neural structures.
